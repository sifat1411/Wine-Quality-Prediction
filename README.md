# Wine-Quality-Prediction


Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction Project repository, a part of my internship at Bharat Intern. In this project, I've applied data science and machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wines based on various attributes. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions to explore and reproduce the results.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model that can assess the quality of wines based on attributes such as acidity, residual sugar, alcohol content, and more. By analyzing and understanding the relationships between these features and wine quality, I aimed to create an accurate model for predicting wine ratings.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Includes Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Contains trained machine learning models.
- `src/`: Houses source code and utility scripts for data processing and model evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To explore this project and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to explore the Jupyter notebooks.
4. Run the preprocessing notebook to clean and prepare the dataset.
5. Train and evaluate the predictive model using the provided notebooks.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different algorithms, and fine-tune parameters to enhance the model's predictive performance.

## Acknowledgments

I extend my gratitude to Bharat Intern for offering me the opportunity to work on this insightful project and gain practical experience in data science. Successfully predicting wine quality has been an enlightening journey, and I'm thrilled to have achieved this milestone.
